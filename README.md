# POAP_Eth_xDai

This project is part of my internship at Anyblock Analytics. Anyblock Analytics is a German blockchain solution provider. Here I was working on real-time Ethereum blockchain data to help the firm build a dashboard for Ethereum tokens. During my internship, I have worked in the Jupyter notebooks on Google Collab to effectively collaborate the work as a team, have used Elasticsearch API for blockchain data querying, Pandas and Numpy for exploratory data analysis, and Plotly, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries for data visualization.
